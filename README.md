If you have issues with installing dependencies in your computer, you can always open this repository from Ona by clicking this button:

[![Open in Ona](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/upcschool-ai/aidl-2026-winter-mlops/)

You'll have to log onto Ona, which you can do using your Github account (clicking on Login with Github).
